## Development

**For an optimal developer experience, it is recommended to install [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).**

Make sure Docker is installed with Buildx.

Fetch required tools:

```shell
task deps
```

Build artifacts locally:

```shell
task build
```

Deploy services and access [OASF webpage](http://localhost:8080) locally:

```shell
task up
```

Run the test suite:

```shell
task test
```

Once you are done, tear down the deployment:

```shell
task down
```
