The digest property acts as a content identifier, enabling content addressability. It uniquely identifies content by taking a collision-resistant hash of the bytes. If the digest can be communicated in a secure manner, one can verify content from an insecure source by recalculating the digest independently, ensuring the content has not been modified. The value of the digest property is a string consisting of an algorithm portion and an encoded portion. The algorithm specifies the cryptographic hash function and encoding used for the digest; the encoded portion contains the encoded result of the hash function. A digest MUST be calculated for all properties except the digest itself which MUST be ignored during the calculation. The model SHOULD then be updated with the calculated digest.",
