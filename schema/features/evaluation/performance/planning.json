Longer paths represent more work, so it is important not to “overshoot” here.\nComplexity Score: total sum of nodes and edges, the higher, the more complex the MAS is.\nRedundancy Score: nodes that are not present in the ground truth graph, are likely to be redundant and so might be the corresponding subtasks.",
