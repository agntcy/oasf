## Introduction to the Framework and Schema

This document describes the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) and its
taxonomy, including the core agents' skills descriptor schema built with the
framework. It is highly inspired by the succesfuly Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OAF)
that the authors have been using previously in the context of cloud threat
detection. OASF leverages the design principles of OASF to build a new
framework dedicated to characterize autonomous agents through their skillset
and cost to solve problems belonging to a number of domains of applications.
